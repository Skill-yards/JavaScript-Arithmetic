# JavaScript-Arithmetic And Function


### JavaScript Arithmetic Operations

In JavaScript, arithmetic operations allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations using operators. These operations are foundational in programming and are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and create algorithms. Here’s an overview of the key arithmetic operations:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: 
   - Combines two numbers to get their sum.

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: 
   - Finds the difference between two numbers by subtracting one from the other.

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: 
   - Multiplies two numbers to get their product.

4. **Division (`/`)**: 
   - Divides one number by another to get the quotient.

5. **Modulus (`%`)**: 
   - Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.

6. **Increment (`++`)**: 
   - Increases a number by one.

7. **Decrement (`--`)**: 
   - Decreases a number by one.

8. **Order of Operations**: 
   - JavaScript follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)).

### Task Questions:

Here are some questions focused on JavaScript arithmetic operations:

1. **Question 1:**
   Write a JavaScript expression to add two numbers, `a` and `b`, and store the result in a variable `sum`. What will be the value of `sum` if `a` is `7` and `b` is `3`?

2. **Question 2:**
   Subtract the variable `b` from the variable `a` and store the result in a variable `difference`. What will be the value of `difference` if `a` is `15` and `b` is `8`?

3. **Question 3:**
   Multiply two numbers, `a` and `b`, and store the result in a variable `product`. What will be the value of `product` if `a` is `6` and `b` is `4`?

4. **Question 4:**
   Divide the variable `a` by the variable `b` and store the result in a variable `quotient`. What will be the value of `quotient` if `a` is `20` and `b` is `4`?

5. **Question 5:**
   Write an expression to find the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` and store it in a variable `remainder`. What will be the value of `remainder` if `a` is `10` and `b` is `3`?

6. **Question 6:**
   Write a JavaScript expression that first adds `a` and `b`, then multiplies the result by `c`. What will be the final result if `a` is `2`, `b` is `3`, and `c` is `4`?

7. **Question 7:**
   Create a JavaScript expression to calculate the average of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. What will be the average if `a` is `5`, `b` is `10`, and `c` is `15`?

8. **Question 8:**
   Write an expression that increments the value of `a` by `1` and then multiplies it by `b`. What will be the result if `a` is `7` and `b` is `5`?



### JavaScript Functions

JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions take input, process it, and return a result. They help in organizing and reusing code efficiently. Here’s an overview of how functions work:

1. **Function Declaration:**
   - A function is declared using the `function` keyword, followed by a name, parameters (optional), and a block of code.
   ```javascript
   function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
       // Code to execute
   }
   ```

2. **Function Invocation:**
   - Functions are called or invoked using their name followed by parentheses.
   ```javascript
   functionName(argument1, argument2);
   ```

3. **Return Statement:**
   - Functions can return a value using the `return` statement.
   ```javascript
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

### Task Questions:

Here are some questions related to JavaScript functions and arithmetic:

1. **Question 9:**
   Write a function `addNumbers` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, adds them, and returns the result. Call this function with the values `7` and `3`. What will be the returned value?

2. **Question 10:**
   Create a function `subtractNumbers` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, subtracts `b` from `a`, and returns the result. Call this function with the values `15` and `8`. What will the function return?

3. **Question 11:**
   Define a function `multiplyNumbers` that multiplies two numbers passed as parameters. Call the function with `6` and `4`. What will be the returned value?

4. **Question 12:**
   Write a function `divideNumbers` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Call this function with the values `20` and `4`. What is the returned result?

5. **Question 13:**
   Create a function `calculateRemainder` that accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. What will be the result when you call the function with `a = 10` and `b = 3`?

6. **Question 14:**
   Write a function `complexCalculation` that adds two numbers `a` and `b`, multiplies the result by a third number `c`, and returns the final result. What will be the result of calling the function with `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 4`?

7. **Question 15:**
   Define a function `averageOfThree` that takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns their average. What is the result when the function is called with `a = 5`, `b = 10`, and `c = 15`?

8. **Question 16:**
   Write a function `incrementAndMultiply` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, increments `a` by 1, multiplies it by `b`, and returns the result. What will be the result of calling the function with `a = 7` and `b = 5`?

9. **Question 17:**
   Create a function `power` that takes two parameters `base` and `exponent`, and returns `base` raised to the power of `exponent`. What will be the result when `base = 3` and `exponent = 4`?

10. **Question 18:**
    Write a function `isEven` that takes a single parameter `number` and returns `true` if the number is even, and `false` if it is odd. Call this function with the value `12`. What will be the returned value?
