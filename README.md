# JavaScript-Arithmetic


### JavaScript Arithmetic Operations

In JavaScript, arithmetic operations allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations using operators. These operations are foundational in programming and are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and create algorithms. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key arithmetic operations:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: 
   - Combines two numbers to get their sum.

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: 
   - Finds the difference between two numbers by subtracting one from the other.

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: 
   - Multiplies two numbers to get their product.

4. **Division (`/`)**: 
   - Divides one number by another to get the quotient.

5. **Modulus (`%`)**: 
   - Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.

6. **Increment (`++`)**: 
   - Increases a number by one.

7. **Decrement (`--`)**: 
   - Decreases a number by one.

8. **Order of Operations**: 
   - JavaScript follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left-to-right), Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)).

### Task Questions:

Here are some questions focused on JavaScript arithmetic operations:

1. **Question 1:**
   Write a JavaScript expression to add two numbers, `a` and `b`, and store the result in a variable `sum`. What will be the value of `sum` if `a` is `7` and `b` is `3`?

2. **Question 2:**
   Subtract the variable `b` from the variable `a` and store the result in a variable `difference`. What will be the value of `difference` if `a` is `15` and `b` is `8`?

3. **Question 3:**
   Multiply two numbers, `a` and `b`, and store the result in a variable `product`. What will be the value of `product` if `a` is `6` and `b` is `4`?

4. **Question 4:**
   Divide the variable `a` by the variable `b` and store the result in a variable `quotient`. What will be the value of `quotient` if `a` is `20` and `b` is `4`?

5. **Question 5:**
   Write an expression to find the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` and store it in a variable `remainder`. What will be the value of `remainder` if `a` is `10` and `b` is `3`?

6. **Question 6:**
   Write a JavaScript expression that first adds `a` and `b`, then multiplies the result by `c`. What will be the final result if `a` is `2`, `b` is `3`, and `c` is `4`?

7. **Question 7:**
   Create a JavaScript expression to calculate the average of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. What will be the average if `a` is `5`, `b` is `10`, and `c` is `15`?

8. **Question 8:**
   Write an expression that increments the value of `a` by `1` and then multiplies it by `b`. What will be the result if `a` is `7` and `b` is `5`?
